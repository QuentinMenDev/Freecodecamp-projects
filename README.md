# Freecodecamp Projects

This repo contain the entirety of the projects I've been making for the Freecodecamp certificatications acquisition. They are organised in folders corresponding to the certification they have been made for. Some of the projects will be present in multiple certifications as they were made for legacy ones.
It is possble that there will be multiple versions of a project, each version trying to achieve a specific aim like:
 - Own fastest way to write a project
 - Shortest amount of lines (with proper linting)
 - Most readable code
 - Most efficient code
 - ... and so on

The list of project listed in that README file will give you a live version of its first version (either codepen.io, repl.it, glitch.com)
